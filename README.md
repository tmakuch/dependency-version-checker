# Dependency Version Checker

This library allows you to run a check for newer versions against your development and production dependencies, both npm and `git://`/`git+ssh://`.

## Motivation

Internal libraries or other dependencies should be as easy to verify as those published to npm. And you should have one tool for that.

## Prerequisites

For git, if you're able to clone the repo, you're able to check the tags.

For npm, there's no support for custom, manual repositories. If you're using custom repository, make it work without any additional parameters.

Configure your npm, git and ssh if you have private repos.

## Disclaimer

This is "for dev by dev" tool. They may be some assumptions made, so do not hesitate to look into verbose logs if something seems not right.

Still, I'll try to list all assumptions in this file.

- Tags are in semver, if they do not pass semver parsing they do not show in the list.

## Installation

`npm install -g dependency-version-checker`

## Usage

Run in your project (you do not need to be exactly in root):

```
dep-versions --help
dep-versions check [rule] //checks dependencies and prints them in table
dep-versions update [rule] //checks dependencies and update them in found package.json
```

#### Rule parameter

- Rule parameter is a string by which successful match against the dependencies.
- Rule parameter may be omitted, but check will be executed against all the dependencies.

#### Example

```
$dep-versions check lod
Performing dependency updates check for project: D:\Documents\Projects\depdency-version-checker\spec\package.json.
Check will be performed for dependencies matching this regex: /lod/.

You could update 1 dependency(/-ies).

Dependency  Type  Current Version  Latest Minor  Latest Major
==========  ====  ===============  ============  ============
lodash      Prod  3.0.0            3.10.1        4.17.11
```

#### Debugging

Run `dep-versions <command> --help` to see additional flags.
